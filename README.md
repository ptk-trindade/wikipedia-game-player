# Wikipedia-Game (Solver)

## What is the Wikipedia Game?
"The Wikipedia game, also known as the Wiki Race or the Wikipedia Challenge, is an online game where players start on a specific Wikipedia page and try to get to another specified page by only clicking on the hyperlinks within Wikipedia articles. The objective is to get to the target page in the fewest number of clicks possible." - ChatGPT (edited)

The goal of this project is to find the path with fewer clicks from one page to another.

> It will basically run a BFS on wikipedia.


## 🔝 Adjustments and improvements

The project already works, but there are a few improvments I'm working on:

- Save wikipedias pages on a database (I'm trying to avoid making many requests to wikipedia)
- Run requests of the same BFS level in concurrency (This is simple to develop, but I want to create the DB cache first)


## 💻 Skills used

* Requests in Go
* Concurrency in Go
* SQL Server database maintenance
