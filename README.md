# Wikipedia-game (Solver)

The wikipedia game you start at a wikipedia page and must reach another given page just by clicking on the links.

The goal of this project is to find the path with fewer clicks from one page to another.

> It will basically run a BFS on wikipedia.


## 🔝 Adjustments and improvements

The project already works, but there are a few improvments I'm working on:

- Save wikipedias pages on a database (I'm trying to avoid making many requests to wikipedia)
- Run requests of the same BFS level in concurrency (This is simple to develop, but I want to create the DB cache first)


## 💻 Technologies being used

* Go 1.19
* SQL Server (Not being used on current GitHub version)
